//A high-level overview of javascript

/*
Low-level - Developers has to manage resources manually

High-level (JS, Python) - Developers does not have to worry, everything happens automatically

Garbage-collection - Cleaning the memory so we don't have to manually.

Interpreted / Just-in-time compiled - 

Abstraction - Converted from machine code to human-readable code.


Multi-paradigm - Javascript can become any of the paradigm below.

Procedural Programming - linear way of coding

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - 

Functional Programming (FP) - 

First-class functions - Simply treated as variables, can pass functions into other functions.

Dynamic - No data type definitions, it is automatically changed whenever needed.

Single-threaded - JS runs in one single thread, so it can only do one thing at a time.

Concurrency Model - JS handles multiples tasks happening at the same time
